## Goal
We create a public and private cloud run service to check if the so called `service to service` communication really works.

## References
* https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/triggering/https-request#service-to-service-private
<i>
the calling function must also provide a Google-signed ID token to authenticate. This is a two step process:
* Create a Google-signed ID token with the audience field (aud) set to the URL of the receiving function.
* Include the ID token in an Authorization: Bearer ID_TOKEN header in the request to the function.
</i>

## Prepare the images 
* build the public service image with cloud build
```
cd public_service
./cbuild.sh
```
* check the built image and write down the image link
```
./checkimg.sh
```

* fill in `terraform.tfvars`
```tf
region = "<your region>"
project = "<your project>"
public_service_image = "<image link>"
```

## Deployment 
```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform deploy
```

## Check result
```

## Test the private service from local
use the gcloud generated token
```sh
./curl_private_service.sh
```
